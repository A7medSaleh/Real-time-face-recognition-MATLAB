This code uses face recognition with real time preformance to
detect the identified users on the spot without need to stop program or hit a button.

Each user is identified by taking five screenshots to his/her face and all identified users can be found in the users list also you can add to the list of users and delete the selected user as you wish.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.
